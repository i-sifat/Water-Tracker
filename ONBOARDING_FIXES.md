# Onboarding Flow Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Wrong Step Order in Flow Screen**
- **Problem**: Age Selection was showing as step 4 instead of step 1
- **Fix**: Reordered the `_getScreenForStep` method to match the logical flow:
  - Step 0: Welcome Screen
  - Step 1: Age Selection Screen âœ…
  - Step 2: Gender Selection Screen
  - Step 3: Weight Selection Screen
  - Step 4: Goal Selection Screen
  - Step 5: Exercise Frequency Screen
  - Step 6: Pregnancy Status Screen
  - Step 7: Sugary Drinks Screen
  - Step 8: Vegetable Intake Screen
  - Step 9: Weather Preference Screen
  - Step 10: Notification Setup Screen
  - Step 11: Data Summary Screen

### 2. **Total Steps Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Provider had 10 total steps but flow screen had 12 steps
- **Fix**: Updated provider to have 12 total steps to match the actual flow

### 3. **Step Validation Logic**
- **Problem**: Validation logic didn't match the new step order
- **Fix**: Updated validation logic in provider:
  - Step 1 (Age): Must have age selected
  - Step 3 (Weight): Must have weight selected
  - Step 4 (Goals): Must have at least one goal selected

### 4. **Optional Steps Configuration**
- **Problem**: Optional steps didn't match new order
- **Fix**: Updated optional steps to: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (gender, pregnancy, sugary drinks, vegetable, weather)

### 5. **Screen Integration**
- **Problem**: Individual screens were using their own navigation instead of provider
- **Fix**: Updated screens to use OnboardingProvider for navigation:
  - Age Selection Screen: Now uses provider.updateAge() and provider.navigateNext()
  - Weight Selection Screen: Now uses provider.updateWeight() and provider.navigateNext()

### 6. **Step Titles and Descriptions**
- **Problem**: Step titles didn't match the new order
- **Fix**: Updated all step titles and descriptions to match the new flow

## Testing Required:

1. **Navigation Flow**: Test that clicking "Continue" from Welcome goes to Age Selection
2. **Data Persistence**: Test that age and weight selections are saved properly
3. **Validation**: Test that "at least select one item" error only shows when appropriate
4. **Back Navigation**: Test that back button works correctly between screens
5. **Skip Functionality**: Test that optional steps can be skipped properly

## Next Steps:

1. Test the complete onboarding flow
2. Update remaining screens to use the provider pattern
3. Fix any remaining navigation issues
4. Ensure data is properly saved and validated
