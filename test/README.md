## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Test Timeouts**
   ```bash
   # Increase timeout for specific tests
   flutter test --timeout=60s
   ```

2. **Widget Not Found**
   ```dart
   // Use pumpAndSettle for animations
   await tester.pumpAndSettle();
   
   // Check widget tree
   debugDumpApp();
   ```

3. **Gesture Recognition Issues**
   ```dart
   // Use specific gesture coordinates
   await tester.dragFrom(startPoint, offset);
   ```

4. **Performance Test Failures**
   ```dart
   // Allow for CI environment variations
   expect(duration, lessThan(Duration(milliseconds: 200))); // More lenient on CI
   ```
