Flutter Water Tracker Modernization Plan (Android Only, Manual Deployment, Intermediate Level)

1. Project Setup and Dependencies (Foundation)

* 1.1. Update Flutter SDK Constraints: Ensure your Flutter SDK is up-to-date and compatible with the latest stable Android development.
* 1.2. Upgrade Dependencies: Upgrade all relevant dependencies (especially `flutter_bloc` and `rxdart`) to their latest stable versions. Focus on dependencies that directly impact state management and UI.
* 1.3. Implement Null Safety: Fully implement null safety throughout the project to improve code reliability and prevent runtime errors.
* 1.4. Add Basic Static Analysis: Implement basic linting rules to catch common coding errors and enforce consistent style.

2. Architecture and Project Structure (Organization)

* 2.1. Reorganize Folder Structure: Implement a simple, clear folder structure that separates UI, state management, and data handling. A basic `lib/` structure with folders like `ui/`, `bloc/`, `data/`, and `models/` is sufficient.
* 2.2. Implement Basic Dependency Injection: Use `get_it` or `provider` for simple dependency injection to manage state and data dependencies.
* 2.3. Implement Basic Error Handling: Add try-catch blocks and simple error messages to handle common exceptions.

3. State Management Modernization (Logic)

* 3.1. Upgrade to Latest `flutter_bloc`: Update to the latest `flutter_bloc` version (8.x or later).
* 3.2. Implement Basic Bloc Patterns: Use `Bloc` or `Cubit` for state management, focusing on clear event-state transitions.
* 3.3. Implement Basic State Immutability: Ensure state objects are immutable to prevent unexpected state changes.
* 3.4. Implement Basic Loading and Error States: Add simple loading and error states to provide better feedback to the user.

4. Data Layer Improvements (Data)

* 4.1. Implement Basic Repository Pattern: Create a simple repository class to handle data fetching and persistence.
* 4.2. Implement Basic Data Models: Define data models using simple classes to represent the water tracking data.
* 4.3. Implement Basic Data Persistence: Use `shared_preferences` or `sqflite` for simple data persistence.
* 4.4. Implement Basic Data Validation: Add simple checks to ensure data integrity.

5. UI/UX Modernization (Presentation)

* 5.1. Implement Material 3 Design: Update the UI to use Material 3 components and styling.
* 5.2. Implement Basic Responsive Design: Ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes.
* 5.3. Implement Basic Theme Management: Allow users to switch between light and dark themes.
* 5.4. Implement Basic Animations: Add subtle animations (e.g., `AnimatedOpacity`, `AnimatedContainer`) to provide visual feedback for user interactions.
* 5.5 Implement Basic Error UI Handling: Display simple error messages or snack bars when errors occur.

6. Navigation and Routing (Navigation)

* 6.1. Implement `GoRouter` for Navigation: Use `GoRouter` for simple and efficient navigation.
* 6.2. Implement Basic Navigation State Management: Use `GoRouter`'s state management features to manage navigation state.
* 6.3. Implement Basic Navigation Error Handling: Display simple error messages when navigation fails.

7. Code Quality and Optimization (Refinement)

* 7.1. Implement Basic Linting Rules: Enforce consistent code style and catch common errors using basic linting rules.
* 7.2. Reduce Code Duplication: Refactor code to eliminate redundant code blocks.
* 7.3. Optimize Performance: Use `const` constructors where possible and avoid unnecessary widget rebuilds.
* 7.4. Implement Basic Memory Management: Dispose of resources properly to prevent memory leaks.

Sequential Implementation:

We will work through this list sequentially. You can provide the project files, and we'll start with "1. Project Setup and Dependencies." After completing that, we'll move to "2. Architecture and Project Structure," and so on. This approach ensures consistency and allows you to address issues systematically.
